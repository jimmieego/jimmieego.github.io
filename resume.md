## SUMMARY
Human factors and user experience researcher skilled in user studies, conceptual design, information architecture, and usability evaluation. Analytical thinker trained as an engineer who prefers to focus on the human element in system design.

## EXPERIENCE
### Digital User Experience Specialist, 10/2011 to Present  
Purdue University Libraries, West Lafayette, IN

- Independently plan and conduct user research including identification of user needs and goals (through interviews, focus groups, and contextual inquiry), as well as task and workflow modeling.  
- Work with development team and content owners to follow user-centered design approach and develop effective user interface and information architecture for library website, web applications and digital collections.  
- Plan and conduct usability assessment to make design recommendations to stakeholders based on user feedback.  

**Projects** include:
- User research, interface design and implementation of a crowdsourcing online help system for library users ([CrowdAsk](https://sites.lib.purdue.edu/crowdask/index.php)).
- User interface design for [Data Management Plan Tool](https://dmptool.org/).
- User study, interface design and usability evaluation for [Purdue University Libraries website](http://www.lib.purdue.edu).
- Usability evaluation and user interface improvement for Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative Central website ([HABRI Central](http://habricentral.org)).

### Research Associate, 09/2009 to 10/2011
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN

**Project 1**: System of Interfaces for Human-Robot Interaction in Emergency Response Teams

- Produced user requirements and design specifications based on cognitive task analysis to communicate and refine design concepts
- Generated workflow and interaction designs for interface components
- Planed, conducted, and analyzed qualitative and quantitative usability tests to validate existing and proposed interface designs
- Developed reusable interface components to project code base

**Project 2**: Human Performance Modeling for Human-Robot Peer-Based Teams

- Designed experiment and developed statistical models to assess task workload in a victim assessment scenario for human-human and human-robot teams
- Worked with participants in the experiment, including briefing, training, physiological data and subjective feedback collection

### Graduate Research Assistant, 08/2006 to 08/2009
Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC

**Project 1**: Anthropomorphism and Emotions in Human-Robot Interaction

- Designed and configured a service robot for medicine delivery.  
- Conducted field evaluations with elderly end-users at two senior centers in North Carolina and collected physiological and subjective responses to robot interface features.  
- Data analysis identified key interface features affecting user emotional experience (arousal and valence) in interacting with service robot.  

**Project 2**: Use of Virtual Reality for Assessing Situation Awareness in Multitasking including Locomotion

- Worked as experimenter with participants to collect gait and situation awareness measures.   
- Conducted statistical data analysis and developed a model of situation awareness for multitasking with locomotion for explaining proactive gait control in response to locomotion hazards.  


### Graduate Research Assistant, 09/2004 to 07/2006
Institute of Human Factors and Ergonomics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China

**Project 1**: eLong.com Travel Website Usability Test and Redesign
-	Conducted user interview and task analysis on existing website.
-	Created user profiles (personas) for prototypes based on cluster analysis of user behavior.
-	Conducted usability test of redesigned flight and hotel search results pages.

**Project 2**: SAP-Supported Cross Culture User Interface Study
-	Designed web portal prototypes and measured Chinese users’ visual search performance.
-	Statistical analysis indicated significant cultural differences of visual search pattern between Chinese and western visual styles.

**Project 3**: Samsung Digital TV User Interface Evaluation and Improvement for Chinese Users
-	Conducted market survey and usability evaluation of existing Digital TV remote control hardware and interface designs. 
-	Developed interface prototypes based on Chinese user preferences.
-	Proposed design guidelines to customize future Digital TVs for Chinese market.
