excerpt: The aim of this project is to gain insight into Chinese users' requirements and expectations of Digital TV, and to identify user interface design challenges to fufill those requirements. This project studied approaches to the localization of Samsung Digital TV product. A competitive analysis between Samsung and existing/potential competitorswas was also conducted.

##Background
In 2004, Samsung needed to understand the characteristics of Chinese TV broadcasting and general TV functions before introducing its first generation Digital TV into the Chinese market. The most important signal resource in China was the satellite signal, and then cable signal and over-the-air broadcast; generally the number of channels was over 50. In China one content provider may provide several channels (e.g. over 10 channels for Beijing TV Station). The Channel number is not fixed with content providers; users can adjust the number to any channel they like. The program schedule is quite flexible. For example, a program can start at 8:33 and end at 9:05. Captions were not widely implemented in China and the keys on remote control were rarely color-coded.


Most of the Chinese seniors or even middle age users have problems with channel searching and setting functions. These tasks are very difficult particularly in China. Some people do manual search once every two to four months because more channels may show up. Some Chinese families set the first 10 â€“ 20 channels manually and fix them, and leave the rest not sorted. Because it is impossible to remember all the channel numbers with regard to the corresponding channels. Some Chinese users will put down a note for help. Because there are too many channels and it is very difficult to locate the desired channel directly, some Chinese users do not use the guide so much. So they will just browse all the channels one by one to look for the interesting program.


##Method
We first asked several usability experts to conduct a heuristic evaluation of Samsung's existing Digital TV user interface. We also recruited a small group of users for one-and-one usability testing. Both the heuristic evaluation of usability testing used the same set of tasks:

- Programming channels
- Setting picture and sound mode
- Setting contrast and brightness
- Setting up favorite channels
- Recording a program

Usability testing:

We also did a competitive analysis by surveying several popular Digital TVs from Samsung's competitors in the market in terms of their offered functions, user centered design, menu navigation, and interaction styles (menu and remote control). From the analysis, we identified places of DTV interface that could be improved as well as usability issues of other brands that Samsung should avoid.

At that time, most of the Chinese TV users did not have a clear idea of what a DTV is. So we decided to form a detailed description of what a typical Chinese user would expect a DTV is. Based on that description, we developed a DTV interface prototype and tested it with users recruited from local community.

##Results
From the heuristic evaluation we identified potential usability problems with experts' importance ratings. In the usability testing with users, we recorded task time, number of errors made, whether an error was recovered, users' comments and thinking process. By synthesizing the heuristic evaluation and usability test results, we categorized the usability problems as:

- Different user mental models
- Inconsistent or confusing terminology
- Poor accessibility design of romote control
- Slow system reponse
- Unclear instructions

We also found that the users were able to quickly accept the idea of Digital TV and associate it with computers or game consoles. And for IT products like Digital TV, Chinese users would not link the expectation and experience with their traditional life experience; they were more focused on the new possibilities from the technology.
