excerpt: This project conceptualizes cultural differences and explores practice in web portal design for Chinese users. With an experiment study, we examined the effects of design styles on visual search performance and attitudes on Chinese people and proposed design guidelines from results. We also investigated prominent culture patterns in web design from Chinese users' perspective and compared the results with previous studies on US and Korean cultures.

##Background
Interest in the influence of culture on user interface design has grown both in the HCI community and IT industry. Culture issue in interface design is especially important in China, with an economy growing quickly and the greatest user populations in the future. This project served as an important basis to thoroughly understand different cultural traits in designing user interface for Chinese users. To incorporate issues arising from the industry, this project conceptualizes cultural differences and explores practice in interface design for Chinese users. With an experiment study, we examined the effects of design style on information search performance and workload of Chinese users and proposed design guidelines from the analysis of results. We also investigated culture patterns in website design from Chinese users' perspective and compared the results with those of the previous study on US and Korean cultures.

##Project Outline
The objective of this project was to contribute knowledge and design practice to SAP enterprise software design for different cultures. The main tasks completed for the project were:  

- Initial investigation, including a review of the literature, and a sampling of a large number of interfaces, aims at identify differences in interface design between Chinese, Korean, European, and US cultures;
- Design and exploration of prototype interfaces which reflect the information organization and design style of current Chinese web portals;  
- Development and deployment of a user study to assess the performance and attitude of two typical Chinese user groups with the prototype interfaces.

##Test Plan
The test is designed to assigning participants to execute a series of practical tasks involving web navigation in 2 different design styles of a web application. In each individual test, the style element of design is controlled. Task content is derived from real application on an e-commerce web site, including registration, browsing, Email, online shopping, and order processing. 

Task types were: 

- (Specific) search and buy specific products; 
- (General) search and buy one type (generally, not confined to specific product).

Each participant will be assigned 8 tasks testing their web navigation performance in the two design style, respectively. The test is divided into two rounds according to the design style. So each participant will carry out 16 tasks totally. The task of each participant is identical and the sequence is a Latin square design for the sake of eliminating any position effect. Variables measured are:

- Task time: The time for accomplishing a single task (in second). This variable is used as measure of efficiency in the web navigation.
- Satisfaction:	Based on standard scale item of satisfaction using 5-point Likert-type scale with 1(strongly disagree) and 5(strongly agree).
- Workload: The amount of work units assigned to a resource over a period of time, measured by NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) to obtain a subjective rating.
- Error: The number of wrong click or choice when task target is specified.

##Results
Important results of the experiment study are:  

- The simple design style did not help participants gain more satisfaction, as it may be expected from a designer's perspective. Nor did the complex design style promote satisfaction when participants finish their tasks, as it may be expected psychologically. In other words, the design style does not make any positive difference in users' subjective satisfaction. From this point we reckon that satisfaction may not be the most important aspect when considering users' perception of web characteristics.

- There are no significant differences in subjective workload between simple and complex design style, either between SAP and Tsinghua participants. This suggests that both the two participant groups are quite compatible to the complex design style, since increased performance time does not necessarily increase their subjective ratings on workload.

- One possible reason to explain why workload of all the participants did not significantly increase in the complex design style is that Chinese users may not consider performance time to be the most important factor when assessing subjective workload (though objective workload increases with time).

- Besides satisfaction, the most possible and important cue when investigating user attitude is Perceived Usability. Interface with complex design style has low perceived usability, especially from the new users' perspective. Chinese users often relate complex interface to high learning effort, and they tend to use or not use the system to the extent they believe how cost and benefit will be.


We also found several interesting cultural patterns in Chinese websites:

- Chinese sites tend to show corporation advertisements (picture or flash) in the center of main page;

- Both fixed menus and dynamic menus are preferred by Chinese web sites;

- For buttons, there were advantages to pictorial and combined modes, compared with the textual mode (see figure below).

Our analysis implies that to increase user satisfaction in the interface, the practitioner need to first understand that different external factors may have different impacts on satisfaction and user attitudes. In this study, changes in performance do not pose significant impact on satisfaction and subjective workload. Thus, satisfaction should be considered more thoroughly together with intrinsic performance gains. The experience from cognitive overload in Chinese web portals transferred into user's perceptions of workload, but this workload resulted from the complex visual design style did not necessarily lead to inferior task performance when the users are familiar with the design.
