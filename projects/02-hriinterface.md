excerpt: This remote operator interface allows a single human supervisor to monitor and task multiple heterogeneous robots. Decreasing the robot to human ratio will be achieved by increasing the operator's awareness of the broad situation while still allowing him or her to interact with each robot at an individual level. To increase the operator's awareness, several interaction widgets have been designed to facilitate the tracking of objects that are no longer visible on the current main map view. These supplemental widgets are called the Halo and the Mini Map.
