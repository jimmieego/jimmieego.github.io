excerpt: This project was an empirical usability evaluation of HABRI (Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative) Central as part of the effort to develop an open access research repository and collaboration platform for human-animal bond researchers. HABRI Central hosts previously published materials from related disciplines and an extensive bibliography, in addition to traditional hub materials such as tools and datasets. Results of the evaluation showed that the overall user experience of HABRI Central was satisfactory, but also indicated a number of usability issues. It is expected that findings from this study and the evaluation methodology can be extended to the development and evaluation of similar research repository systems.
