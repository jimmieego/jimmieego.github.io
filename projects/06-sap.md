excerpt: This project conceptualizes cultural differences and explores practice in web portal design for Chinese users. With an experiment study, we examined the effects of design styles on visual search performance and attitudes on Chinese people and proposed design guidelines from results. We also investigated prominent culture patterns in web design from Chinese users' perspective and compared the results with previous studies on US and Korean cultures.
