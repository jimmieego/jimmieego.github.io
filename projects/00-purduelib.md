title: Redesign Purdue University Libraries Website
folder: projects
type: project
image: images/homepage_mockup_0722.jpg
excerpt: The previous Purdue University Libraries website was designed several years ago. It was based on static HTML pages and there are usability issues like consistency and outdated content. A redesign is needed to introduce a content management system to establish a consistent content strategy. The redesign also needs to meet users' expectation of a modern, sleek, and simple user interface for information discovery and use of the library services. I worked as a user experience researcher/designer to lead the redesign effort. I applied a typical user-centered design process for this project, starting from user research, persona creation, prototyping, implementation, and user testing.
