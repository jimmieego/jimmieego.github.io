excerpt: The objective of this study was to understand the effect of different service robot interface features on elderly perceptions and emotional responses in a simulated medicine delivery task. In general, results indicated that adding anthropomorphic and interactive features to service robots promoted positive emotional responses (increased excitement, Galvanic Skin Response, and happiness, Heart Rate) in elderly users. Results from this study could be used as a basis for developing affective robot interface design guidelines to promote user emotional experiences.
